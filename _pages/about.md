Hi, I'm Maango. I have a passion for hacking and information security. More about me personally, I'm 19 and on the East Coast.
I've been participating in CTFs, learning about reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and exploit development recently.
Attending university majoring in CS. On the road to becoming OSCP and OSCE certified if I can acquire the funds.
