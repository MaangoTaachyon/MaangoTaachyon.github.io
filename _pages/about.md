Hi, I'm Thomas. 
I have a passion for hacking and information security. I'm 20 and on the East Coast.
I've been participating in CTFs, learning about reverse engineering, binary exploitation for a couple years now

This page will contain posts on my learning experiences, challenges, projects, or just research in my spare time. I hope you enjoy the posts and hopefully learn something new. If you would like to see posts on a certain topic, just reach out to me and Iâ€™ll see what I can do. Also, feedback is much appreciated!

Currently working as a Cyber Security Analyst.
